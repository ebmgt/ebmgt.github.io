	<div style="text-align: center">“I have you for your strength and mechanical ability. We have other men paid for thinking.”<br/>attributed to Frederick Taylor c1910</div>
	<div style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</div>
	<div>Numerous organizations appear to persist with Taylor's paradigm of confining the workforce to obedient execution. Conversely, alternative forms of “enabling leadership” (Uhl-Bien & Arena, 2018) have emerged, advocating a contrasting strategy nurturing proactive employee engagement. Our project addresses whether we can simultaneously improve organizational performance and workforce well-being by using specific, “enabling” management strategy. </div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>

  <div style="font-weight: bold">Methods</div>
	<div>In 2021, we introduced "intent-based leadership," aligning with complexity leadership theory and self-determination theory (SDT) for innovation and engagement, respectively. 
    <br/>
Starting in 2020, our clinic annually surveyed staff, while other clinics participated sporadically.  The survey measured states of well-being and theory-based antecedents of the states. We emphasized questions that had benchmarks from large populations.  
    <br/>
The well-being assessment used UWES-3 to gauge engagement dimensions (vigor, dedication, absorption). The survey includes the single-item burnout questionnaire (SIBOQ). The survey also measured job satisfaction and Spreitzer’s thriving (ongoing learning and improvement). For measuring antecedents of states, the survey was rooted in the self-determination theory of work engagement (autonomy, mastery, membership, meaningfulness) and the job demands-resource model (burden, resources) of burnout.   
    <br/>
Additionally, in 2021 we prioritized and started monitoring of 14 HEDIS and MIPS clinical Quality Improvement. 
    <br/>
Due to the small sample size, we focused on descriptive statistics. </div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>

	<div style="font-weight: bold">Results</div>
	<div>Response rates across different periods were as follows: 60% (2023), 46% (2022), 75% (2021, internal medicine community clinic only), and unavailability of rates for 2020. Excluding resident physicians, annual respondents in the resident clinic were: 16 (2023), 17 (2022), and 17 (2021), with 9 in 2020.  
<br/>
Following the adoption of intention-based leadership in June 2021, notable trends emerged: 3 measures surpassed national benchmarks in 2021, followed by 8 in 2022, and 6 in 2023.  Statistical analysis of the drop in burnout revealed a ‘very strong’ although statistically insignificant correlation with a rho value of -0.8 and a p-value of .08.  </div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>

	<div style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion</div>
	<div>Our study, despite limited data, underscores that implementing enabling and complexity-based leadership in adaptable settings can bolster both Quality Improvement and well-being. This finding matches our earlier, much larger study that measured a virtuous cycle within the English National Health Service hospitals, where workforce well-being and organizational performance may have mutually reinforced each other.  Our study also demonstrates the importance of a yearly collection of key performance indicators to monitor changes.
